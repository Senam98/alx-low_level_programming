# Low-Level Programming - Data Structures, Algorithms, Linux/Unix System Programming


This repository contains programs written for the low-level programming and
algorithm track at Holberton School.In these projects, which  occurred
throughout the duration of the Year 1 curriculum, I learned about data
structures, algorithms, and other low-level programming concepts while
working in the C language. The specific list of projects contained follows:
